# Professional Portfolio

## Description

The motivation for completing this project was to have an up-to-date portfolio displaying the work done in boot camp. I built this project for two reasons: to further understand flexbox, HTML structural elements, semantic tags, and how to style a webpage with CSS, and to create a working display of my projects for future employers. 

This project will culminate all of my future works into one place, displaying the skills I will learn as a coder, so it solves the problem of showcasing my abilities. I learned how to use flexbox and how to incorporate classes and ids into an HTML file.
